# AI-CHATBOT-PYTHON

Welcome to the README file for your conversational AI chatbot made with PyTorch! This chatbot is designed to have simple yet engaging conversations with users, using a seed forward neural net.

To use this chatbot, you will need to have PyTorch installed on your machine. If you don't already have it installed, you can download it from the PyTorch website.

Once you have PyTorch installed, you can run the chatbot script by navigating to the directory where the script is located and running the following command in your terminal:
```python
python chat.py
```
This will start up the chatbot and you will be able to have a conversation with it. The chatbot works by taking in user input and generating a response based on the input and its own internal state. The neural net used in this chatbot is a simple seed forward neural net that has been trained on a dataset of conversation examples.

You can customize the chatbot's responses by editing the dataset that it is trained on. The dataset is stored in a text file, and each line in the file represents a conversation example. To add new examples to the dataset, simply add new lines to the file in the format "input\toutput".

The chatbot also includes some basic functionality for handling user input errors, such as when the user inputs something that the chatbot doesn't understand. If the chatbot doesn't understand the user's input, it will respond with a message indicating that it didn't understand and prompt the user to try again.

Overall, this conversational AI chatbot made with PyTorch provides a simple yet effective way to engage with users and have interesting conversations. Feel free to customize the chatbot to meet your specific needs and have fun chatting!
